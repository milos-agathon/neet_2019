How to make a choropleth map of Europe using Eurostat data and <200 lines of R code

In the last few years, I've created a myriad of chropleth maps using Eurostat's data. This repo demonstrates how to create one such map of Europe on NUTS 2 level. For this exercise, you will import shapefile and data from the Eurostat website into R and make a choropleth map of NEETs. Enjoy!
